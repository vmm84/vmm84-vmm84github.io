      <p>Lebanon is in the middle east on the eastern side of the mediterranean sea. It borders Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south. Although it is in the middle east, Lebanon is not a country full of hot sandy deserts, but mountains cover the country. The three largest cities in Lebanon are Tripoli, Beirut, and Sidon, with its capital being Beirut. Lebanon is a cultural melting pot, filled with people from different religions and cultures. Arabic is the most popular language, and Islam is the most common religion.</p>
