  <h2>Confidence is Your Best Friend!</h2>
<p>CONFIDENCE IS KEY! This may be the most important one yet. If I had a dollar for every time I went out in that skirt that was way too tight or those jeans from three seasons ago and immediately regretted my decision; I might be able to buy that vintage Chanel bag I have wanted since I was four! The point is, making sure you feel your best and most confident in your outfit is the biggest tip I could ever give. You truly do look your best when you feel your best</p>
