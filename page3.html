  <h1>Balling on a Budget?</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let's be honest. We all don't have $500 to be updated on the latest trends. And even if you do, is that where you want to spend your money?

Nonetheless, If you're anything like me, you are balling on a budget.

Here is some top-secret intel: No one cares about the price tag of your outfit!

With a chic style, I've seen people transform a $20 outfit into a ready-for-the-runway look. From one struggling college girl, who gets serious fashion FOMO, let me help you look banging on a budget.

  <h3>Let's Get Thrifty</h3>
  <p>Ah ha...Thrifting. The fashionista's top secret. Whether you do it because of how affordable it is or because you have a deep love for the vintage aesthetic, thrifting seems always to be the answer. Not only can you find unique pieces that make your personality pop, but it's also affordable! Thrifting is my favorite way to buy outside the basic box (cough cough Zara) and show everyone who I am! It's also great for the environment! Go thrifting to save your cash, be sustainable and look sexy! </p>

  <h3>Let's Talk Dupes...</h3>
</section>
  <p>We can all agree that fashion pieces can be overpriced, but with our little friend, dupes, we can sport trendy lookalike pieces that would otherwise break the bank. Dupes can be found on sites like Revolve to even Amazon. However, buying a dupe versus buying a fake is very different.  Remember: buy dupes, not fakes! </p>

    <h3>Let's Add a Pop</h3>
    <p>How often do you find yourself wearing the same outfit over and over again? Because that happens to me quite often, I learned that the whole look is transformed with a pop of color. I changed my basic jeans and white t-shirt fit by adding a fun red sneaker paired with a red lip. Trust me when I say it made all the difference! </p>
