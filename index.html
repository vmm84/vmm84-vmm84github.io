        <h2>About Me!</h2>

      <h2>Why Do I Love Fashion?</h2>
      <p> Fashion is and always will be a part of my life. From a young age, I would spend my time playing dress-up, a phase I never seemed to grow out of; I love sharing tips, hacks, and even clothes with those I love. A person's fashion sense will tell you a lot about someone and their unique personality.</p>
