        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>  My name is Vivianne Martell, but everyone calls me Vivi! I'm a 21-year-old student studying Journalism and Media management. Growing up in Miami, fashion has always been part of my life. I have always loved using fashion to express myself and connect with people over a shared love for it. Fashion is a unique way to connect with friends, family, and even strangers, and it also helps you learn a lot about the people around you. </p>

      <h2>Why Do I Love Fashion?</h2>
      <p> Fashion is and always will be a part of my life. From a young age, I would spend my time playing dress-up, a phase I never seemed to grow out of; I love sharing tips, hacks, and even clothes with those I love. A person's fashion sense will tell you a lot about someone and their unique personality.</p>
